<p>Instead, there was the web, and on the web, there were blogs:</p>
<p>the best place to find alternative thoughts, news and analysis.</p>
<p>They were my life.It had all started with 9/11. I was in Toronto,</p>
<p>and my father had just arrived from Tehran for a visit.</p>
<p>We were having breakfast when the second plane hit the World Trade Center.</p>
<p>I was puzzled and confused and, looking for insights and explanations,</p>
<p>I came across blogs. Once I read a few, I thought: This is it,</p>
<p>I should start one, and encourage all Iranians to start blogging as well.</p>
<p>So, using Notepad on Windows , I started experimenting.</p>
<p>Soon I ended up writing on hoder.com, using Bloggerâ€™s publishing platform before Google bought it.</p>
<p>That sparked something that was later called a blogging revolution:</p>
<p>and I was proud to have a role in this unprecedented democratization of writing.Those days,</p>
<p>I was the first person any new blogger in Iran would contact,</p>
<p>it was a silly nickname, but at least it hinted at how much I cared.</p>
