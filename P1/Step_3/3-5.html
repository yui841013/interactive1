<h5>It had all started with <em>9/11</em>. I was in Toronto, and my father had just arrived from Tehran for a visit. We were having breakfast when the second plane hit the World Trade Center. I was puzzled and confused and, looking for insights and explanations, I came across blogs. Once I read a few, I thought: This is it, I should start one, and encourage all Iranians to start blogging as well. So, using Notepad on Windows, I started experimenting. Soon I ended up writing on
	<em><a href="http://hoder.com/">hoder.com</a></em>, using Blogger’s publishing platform before Google bought it.
</h5>
<h5 id="var1">Then, on <em>November 5, 2001</em>, I published a step-to-step guide on how to start a blog. That sparked something that was later called a blogging revolution: Soon, hundreds and thousands of Iranians made it one of the top 5 nations by the number of blogs, and I was proud to have a role in this unprecedented democratization of writing.
</h5>

<h5>Those days, I used to keep a list of all blogs in Persian and, for a while, I was the first person any new blogger in Iran would contact, so they could get on the list. That’s why they called me <strong>“the blogfather”</strong> in my mid-twenties — it was a silly nickname, but at least it hinted at how much I cared.</p>
