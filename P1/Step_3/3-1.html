<p id="pos1">Instead, there was the web, and on
	the web, there were blogs: the best place to find alternative thoughts, news
	and analysis. They were my life.</p>
<p id="pos2">It had all started with 9/11. I was in Toronto, and my father had just arrived from Tehran for a
visit. We were having breakfast when the second plane hit the World Trade Center.
 I was puzzled and confused and, looking for insights and explanations, I came
 across blogs. Once I read a few, I thought: This is it, I should start one, and
  encourage all Iranians to start blogging as well. So, using Notepad on Windows
	, I started experimenting. Soon I ended up writing on hoder.com, using Blogger’s
	 publishing platform before Google bought it.</p>

<p id="pos3">Then, on November 5, 2001,
	I published a step-to-step guide on how to start a blog. That sparked something
	that was later called a blogging revolution: Soon, hundreds and thousands of
	Iranians made it one of the top 5 nations by the number of blogs, and I was
	proud to have a role in this unprecedented democratization of writing.</p>

<p id="pos4">Those days, I used to keep a list of all blogs in
	Persian and, for a while, I was the first person any new blogger in Iran would
	contact, so they could get on the list. That’s why they called me “the
	blogfather” in my mid-twenties — it was a silly nickname, but at least it
	hinted at how much I cared.</p>
